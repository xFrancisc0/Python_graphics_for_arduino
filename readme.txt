This projects works with arduino (.ino) and python (.py) files.

First, the arduino will get the temperature and humidity (.ino file inside the 
folder "codigo_arduino", for this project we only will use the temperature, not
the humidity).

Next, the code "codigo_python_emisor.py" will be working together with the .ino
file. The .ino will get the temperature and "codigo_python_emisor.py" will
get the data from the .ino file. After this, it will be creating JSON. The time
and the temperature at that time will be saved on the JSON. 

Next, the JSON will be saved in input.json file that is auto-generated by
"codigo_arduino_emisor.py".

Finally, with codigo_python_receptor_generador.py the JSON is imported and it is
graphed by python's component: Pandas. Using pd.DataFrame(var), it will parse
the JSON data into graphicable data by plot command used in python.
